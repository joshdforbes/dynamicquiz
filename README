Dynamic Quiz Revision 5
-----------------------
Revisiting my previous work on the quiz brought me to the realization
that the code, while functional, was not ideal for readability or maintenance.
So the 5th revision to the quiz is a complete rewrite to the application,
the primary focus being on keeping funcitons small and organized.

Other additions include:
* Handlebars templates for HTML generation
* Actual JSON for the quiz questions
* Retrieving the JSON using a jquery AJAX call
* The use of promise objects to handle async operations


Dynamic Quiz Revision 4
-----------------------
*Added jquery animations for transition between questions
*code cleaned up via suggestions from JSHint


Dynamic Quiz Revision 3
-----------------------
Refactored the quiz:
* Added jquery
* moved questions to a seperate file
* general cleanliness
